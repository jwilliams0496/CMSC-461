# About this Project

The project was previously not on GitHub because it was individual work. However since completing the course, I have uploaded all code here for showcasing.

This project is a database for a fake company called Book Fetch Inc. This company wished to create a database to keep track of their books, along with user information (such as students using the database, and employees servicing the database) and university 
information (such as the university name, the departments and courses offered, the instructors that teach the courses, and the books used by each course) This information was all compiled into one database, and the dump files for creating the database are 
included here.

The project was submitted in phases. Each phase is divided into folders the phases are as follows:

## Phase 1
This was the requirements phase of the project, which involved a short write up of my understanding of the project

## Phase 2
This was the logical design phase, which included a ER diagram of the schema, and another write up to document my design choices in the ER diagram

## Phase 3
This was the physical design phase which included a Relational diagram of the schema, and another write up to document my design choices in the Relational Diagram

## Phase 4
This was the implementation of the database which included the sql dump files to create and fill the database with data, along with another write up describing any changes I made to the schema during the implementation

## Phase 5
This phase was different from the database design and implementation because it involved making programs to interface with the database. I included different user modules to interface with the database, and a sample of queries that can be preformed on the 
database

## Notes
These phases have been unchanged since their submissions. The changes between phases have been documented at each stage, but the phases themselves have remained identical since they were submitted. Therefore some of the information shared between phases (eg. 
requirements, write ups, diagrams, code, etc) may not be consistant between phases.

This code has been uploaded for the sole purpose of showcasing my work. I have plans in the future to expand this work on this database, possible involving a website to interface with the database and not just python modules. More in the future.
